# Module Map

## Purpose
Maps high-level features or domains to the specific code modules or services that implement them.

## Template Content

### Feature-to-Module Mapping
- **User Authentication**
  - **Service**: Auth Service
  - **Primary Modules**:
    - `src/services/auth/`
    - `src/core/user.js`
    - `src/api/auth.js`
- **Payment Processing**
  - **Service**: Payments Service
  - **Primary Modules**:
    - `src/services/stripe/`
    - `src/core/payment.js`
    - `src/api/payment.js`

## Architecture Notes
- **Monolithic**: Modules are directories within a single codebase.
- **Microservices**: Modules are independent services, each in its own repository or directory.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Map bounded contexts to their corresponding modules/services.

## Validation
- [ ] All major features are mapped to code.
- [ ] Module paths are correct.
- [ ] The mapping reflects the current system architecture.

## Updates
- Update when new features are added or existing code is refactored into new modules.
- Frequency: At the end of each sprint/milestone.
