# System Architecture

## Purpose
Describes the high-level architectural pattern and the interaction between major system components.

## Template Content

### Architectural Style
- **Primary Pattern**: `{{ARCHITECTURAL_PATTERN}}` - e.g., Microservices, Modular Monolith.
- **Diagram**: `{{LINK_TO_DIAGRAM}}` - e.g., Link to a C4 model, UML diagram, or Mermaid chart.

### Key Components
- **`{{COMPONENT_1_NAME}}`**: `{{COMPONENT_1_DESCRIPTION}}` - e.g., API Gateway: Handles all incoming client requests and routes them.
- **`{{COMPONENT_2_NAME}}`**: `{{COMPONENT_2_DESCRIPTION}}` - e.g., Authentication Service: Manages user identity and access control.
- **`{{COMPONENT_3_NAME}}`**: `{{COMPONENT_3_DESCRIPTION}}` - e.g., Product Catalog Service: Manages product data.

## Architecture Notes
- **Monolithic**: All components are part of a single deployment unit. Communication is via in-process calls.
- **Microservices**: Each component is an independently deployable service. Communication via APIs (e.g., REST, gRPC).
- **Serverless**: Components are implemented as functions. Communication is event-driven.
- **Event-Driven**: Components communicate asynchronously via a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

## Validation
- [ ] The architectural diagram is up-to-date.
- [ ] Component responsibilities are clearly defined.
- [ ] The chosen pattern aligns with project goals.

## Updates
- Update when a new service is added or a component's responsibility changes significantly.
- Frequency: Before starting major feature work that impacts architecture.
