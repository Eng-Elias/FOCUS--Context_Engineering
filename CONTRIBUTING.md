# Contributing to the FOCUS Framework

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the FOCUS Framework. It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/Eng-Elias/FOCUS--Context_Engineering/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork the repository](https://github.com/Eng-Elias/FOCUS--Context_Engineering/fork) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be 
`<feature|bugfix>/issue#<issue_number>-<short_description>` 
(where issue #33 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b feature/issue#33-add-a-bigger-button
```

### Get the test suite running

Make sure you're able to run the test suite locally.

### Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help.

### Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your main branch and make sure it's up to date with the latest upstream version of the code. Then, update your feature branch from your local copy of main, and push it!

Finally, go to GitHub and [make a Pull Request](https://github.com/Eng-Elias/FOCUS--Context_Engineering/compare) :D
